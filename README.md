This is my project using Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning methods to find the optimal State Action pairs for Blackjack. 

Currently, actions are limited to HIT and STAND, looking to add Doubling and Splitting soon. 

I set an exploration probability of 10% to explore new pathways rather than the optimal, and an update step size of 1/5000. Total number of simulations is 10 million. 

Here are the results and strategies for Usable(hard) and Non USable Ace(soft)
